# Tactile-Vision
Code for two Raspberry Pi Pico Ws which allows the visually impaired to gain a better sense of their surroundings using technology. The first Pi will control 6 ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04) which all goes on a headband sitting on the user's head, capturing 6 different angles so the user can sense a range of their surroundings. The sensors collect the data periodically and the Pi determines the distance of nearby objects from the user. The second Pi is on a PCB on the user's hand, where 6 rows of five resistors are arranged in a circle on the PCB. Distance data is transmitted via Bluetooth from the Pi on the user's head to the Pi in the user's hand, and depending on the distance, 1 or 0 resistors in each row will heat up depending on how close an object is to them, where the closer the heated up resistor is to the center of the PCB, the closer the object is to the user.
